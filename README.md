practicing git commands
1. git remote add origin <.git link>
2. git remote -v

This command adds a remote repository named "origin" to the local Git repository with the URL "git@github.com:username/repository.git".

On the other hand, "git remote -v" is a command that shows all the remote repositories that are connected to your local Git repository, along with their corresponding URLs. The "-v" option stands for "verbose" and displays the URLs along with the remote repository names.
