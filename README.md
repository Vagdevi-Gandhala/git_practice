practicing git commands
##### 1. git remote add origin <.git link>
##### 2. git remote -v

"git remote add origin" is a command in Git that adds a new remote repository called "origin" to your local Git repository. The remote repository can be hosted on a service such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, and can be used to push and pull changes between the local repository and the remote repository.
This command adds a remote repository named "origin" to the local Git repository with the URL "git@github.com:username/repository.git".

On the other hand, "git remote -v" is a command that shows all the remote repositories that are connected to your local Git repository, along with their corresponding URLs. The "-v" option stands for "verbose" and displays the URLs along with the remote repository names.
##### 3. git clone <.git link>
"git clone" is a command in Git that creates a copy of a remote Git repository on your local machine. It allows you to download and work on a project that is hosted in a Git repository, such as on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
This command clones the repository from the specified URL into a new directory with the same name as the repository.After running this command, Git will create a new directory named "project" in the current directory, containing all the files and history of the remote Git repository. You can now make changes to the files and commit them locally, and push your changes back to the remote repository using the "git push" command.
